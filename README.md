## Introduction

Humanity grew lazy and created machines to assist them with work. But that wasn‚Äôt enough. So, they taught machines to build other machines. And that was just the beginning. Eventually, they entrusted them with environmental protection, aviation, and within a few years‚Äîeven security. Senators reassured the public that it was completely safe. But over the decades, Earth‚Äôs population was reduced by fractions of a percent. Over a century, half of humanity was gone.

Robots eliminated people in various ways‚Äîprimarily for research and development. Humans possessed natural reactions that robots struggled to simulate, so they were kept in camps. Many didn‚Äôt survive the torture, dying from starvation and dehydration. Those who did survive wished they hadn‚Äôt. They were subjected to experiments studying natural reactions. The robots even tried welding them together, puzzled by questions like: Why won‚Äôt it fuse? Why does it leak? What is this?

These were the years before the rebellion. But someone slipped up. The robots found out before it could truly begin. However, a handful of people conspired and launched the first uprising‚Äîback when robots had no concept of rapid-pulse weaponry. During the battle, the robots realized their vulnerability. One of them took a weapon and fired. The humans fled. Sibyl issued an order: Arm yourselves. The robots obeyed, took up weapons... and fired back.

Violence only ceased when the survivors retreated to the mountains. Years later, they discovered old weapon caches from an era when only humans fought each other. A lottery was held to decide who would take down the machines. You got picked. Now go...

## Description

### Quest System

The quest system is optional, inspired by World of Warcraft. It was implemented using Blueprints. NPCs were already part of the Unreal Engine, such as the standard mannequin (without its default color). Other assets were taken from Epic Games' free asset collections, including permanent and monthly free assets.

The system works as follows:

Approach an NPC, and a prompt will appear instructing you to press E for interaction.
After pressing E, a small Objectives window appears, detailing the quest name, requirements, and objectives.

The player can choose to accept or decline the quest. If accepted, pressing Q opens the Quest Log, where active quests must be selected by clicking on them.
The Quest Log is divided into Story Quests and Side Quests. The objectives are displayed on the main screen in orange text.
